MuuTimer is a simple kitchen timer written in Python and using TK for
GUI. It's behaviour can be controlled from the command line by using
various command line options. It runs on GNU/Linux and Windows.

USAGE

$ muutimer --help

Usage: muutimer [options]

When using the different time options they will all add up so that you
can, for example, set the timer to one hour and fifteen minutes by
using -H 1 and -m 15 at the same time.

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SECONDS, --seconds=SECONDS
                        Time in seconds
  -m MINUTES, --minutes=MINUTES
                        Time in minutes
  -H HOURS, --hours=HOURS
                        Time in hours
  -a ACTION, --action=ACTION
                        Set the action name
  --tick                Turn tick sound on
  --no-finish-sound     Turn finish sound off
  --no-start            Turn auto start off
  --time-in-title       Display time in the window title
  --sound=SOUND         Sound file to play when time reaches zero. Must be a
                        16 bit WAV file
  -d, --debug           Enable debug output

By default, MuuTimer will start a timer of five minutes, with no tick
sound and with finish sound enabled.

THE IDEA

The idea behind having these options on the command line is to be able
to make shortcuts or command aliases to commonly used timer
scenarios. Instead of making the UI overly complicated or using a
settings file with timer presets you simple create shortcuts for
whatever purposes you like.

EXAMPLES

Here are some examples to get you started.

15 minutes timer with tick sound enabled:

 $ muutimer -m 15 --tick

Relax and take a micro typing break for half a minute:

 $ muutimer -s 30 -a "Typing break"

NOTES

Make sure the two wav files are in the same folder as the
program.
